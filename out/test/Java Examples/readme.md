# Assignment 5  
### File Input/Output and exceptions

For this assignment you will use the World Happiness Report 2017 dataset found on https://www.kaggle.com. All of your code can be placed in a main class. Data needed for the program will be read in from the file. Handle file input exceptions. Users should be able to select from a menu until they quit:

- Enter a country to get its happiness rank
- Enter a happiness rank between 1 and 155 to return the country
- quit

Keep track of the number of inquiries made and append this to a file called log.txt. Handle file output exceptions
