# Interface and Comparable lab

### Objectives

* Design another interface Combine<T>  with method public T combine(T t1). This method combines two objects in some way (needs to be defined by the class that implements this interface) and returns the new object of the same type

* Modify    RationalNumber class so that it implements Combine<T> interface in a way that adds two rational numbers.  The algorithm for adding two rational numbers are given below:

* Modify RationalNumber class so that it implements Comparable Interface. The goal is to compare two rational numbers.  

* Modify the tester class so that it invokes the compareTo() method and displays which rational number is greater than the other.
