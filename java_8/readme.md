# Lab 2 Conditionals and Loops

* create a smallestint class that prompts the user for four integers (w, x, y, and z) and prints the smallest value contained in those variables.  

* create a guessSum class that adds integers 1 through 100. then using while loop which will take integers from the user and add them. The program will continue to ask the user to enter any integer to add, until the user enters 0. The program will finally display the sum of all the numbers user has entered.

* Write the GussSumDoWhile class thats the same program using do-while loop. Compare the outputs. Did you get the same outputs by these two programs for same inputs? If not, explain why outputs were not the same. (You do not have to do anything if the outputs are the same.)
