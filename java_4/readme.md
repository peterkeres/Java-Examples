# 8.1 challange 
 * Read a file and count the number of words,
 characters, and lines are in that file
 
* Modify **DialogBoxInput** so that it correctly handles those exceptions and prints appropriate message when these exceptions occur.
 * Modify **DialogBox2** to add a “finally” clause. The finally  clause is executed no matter how the try block is exited. If no exception is thrown, the finally clause is executed after the try block is complete. If an exception is thrown, the appropriate catch clause is executed, and then the finally clause is executed.  See the syntax of finally clause from the book (page 445).
